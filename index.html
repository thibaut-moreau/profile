        <p>I'm passionate about digital and how brands can interact with their customers.
           I live this passion through taking part in digital projects with talented teams using agile methodologies to evolve constantly by challenging the status quo.
           Establishing trusting and long lasting relationships with the people I have the chance to work with is for me a priority and a pleasure.
